# With Nothing

With Nothing is a 2d rpg that is inspired by the storytelling tabletop role playing game created by team member vulpineblazeyt in the theme of the LD45 challenge " Start with nothing "

Click anywhere on the opening screen to start the game.
Controls: arrow keys and or the  A W S D keys to move player.
Collecting wood for the fire is your first goal, but try to avoid specters they're dangerous.

You woke up alone… or did you… the Nothing can give you power, but should you use it?
You could just rely on the strength within you, but who are you? You can't seem to remember…
Does the Nothing have answers?
Because all you have is Nothing...


This the first time ShellDragonGirl has taken part in a game challenge and is new to coding and game development. With Nothing will be her first published game ever!

Teammate vulpineblazeyt has already had a few LD challenges under his belt and is showing SDG the ropes.

Together we're happy to share with you With Nothing!
Please enjoy!
